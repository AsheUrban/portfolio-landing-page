  <h2>Learn a little about me and check out my projects from week 1 at Epicodis!</h2>

  <p> Welcome! I am very new to coding but am excited to share what I'm learning. It's a little messy so far, but I can tell my brain is enjoying new connections and is onboarding the information quickly.</p>

  <p>My background is in community development and social change and digital marketing. While I started learning about physical places and how people interact in them, at the begininng of my career, I am now neck deep in digital spaces trying to figure out some of the same things! Namely: how do people behave in a digital space and how can we help facilitate better user experiences?</p>

  <p>When I'm not at my desk, you'll likely find me one of few places: the slopes, the trails, the campfire, or curled up at home resting.</p>
