      <h2>Learn a little about me and check out my projects from <em>week 1 at Epicodis!</em></h2>
    </div>
    <p class="intro"><strong> Welcome!</strong> I've just started coding but am excited to share what I've learned this week. It's a little messy so far, but I can tell my brain is enjoying new connections and is onboarding the information quickly.</p>

  <h2>ABOUT ME</h2>
  <p>My background is in community development and social change and digital marketing. While I started learning about physical places and how people interact in them, at the begininng of my career, I am now neck deep in <span class="highlight">digital spaces</span> trying to figure out some of the same things! Namely: how do people behave in a digital space and how can we help facilitate better <span class="highlight">user experiences?</span></p>
  <p>When I'm not at my desk, you'll likely find me one of few places:</p>  
    <ul>
      <li>the slopes,</li>
      <li>the trails,</li>
      <li>the campfire,</li>
      <li>curled up at home resting.</li>
    </ul>
