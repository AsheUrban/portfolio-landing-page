    <h2>Learn a little about me and check out my projects from <em>week 1 at Epicodis!</em></h2>
    <p class="intro"><strong> Welcome!</strong> I am very new to coding but am excited to share what I'm learning. It's a little messy so far, but I can tell my brain is enjoying new connections and is onboarding the information quickly.</p>
  </div>
    <div class="my-class">My background is in community development and social change and digital marketing. While I started learning about physical places and how people interact in them, at the begininng of my career, I am now neck deep in <span class="highlight">digital spaces</span> trying to figure out some of the same things! Namely: how do people behave in a digital space and how can we help facilitate better <span class="highlight">user experiences?</span>
    <p>When I'm not at my desk, you'll likely find me one of few places: the slopes, the trails, the campfire, or curled up at home resting.</p>
